          Speech and Language Processing with Applications
          </p>
          <p>
          <span className="font-bold">Objective:</span> This course concerns with analysis and processing of speech signals for development of different voice biometric based applications. The course will provide hands-on experience to the participants about various tasks involved in the analysis of speech signal for extraction of different information, detection of different events in speech signal, development of speech enhancement systems, development of speech recognition systems, speaker recognition systems, speaker diarization systems, language identification systems and their applications for different real word applications. The course will also include several invited talks from the leading experts working in different application areas of speech and Language processing. Such invited talks may ignite the research community to look the speech and Language processing technology from a different perspective.
          </p>
