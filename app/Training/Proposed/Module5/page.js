            Wireless communications technology has developed without measure in the past ten years. It’s the era of various advanced wireless technologies like CDMA/WCDMA, WLAN, WiMax, LTE and OFDMA. Software defined radio and cognitive radio technologies are also the upcoming area for better spectrum utilization. As a result of these rapid developments in the field, involved individuals need to build and sharpen their skills for present and future Wireless industries.
All of these capabilities are based on the ability of engineers to design sophisticated RF circuits that are energy efficient, high in performance, small in size, and economically practical.
This course is intended to provide participants with leading edge specialized knowledge in for advancement in career and productivity. The program incorporates basics of digital and wireless communication, latest wireless technologies, such as courses in GSM/UMTS (Global System for Mobile/ Universal Mobile Telecommunication System), IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15, WiMax, LTE and other CDMA-specific wireless technologies. With the introduction of the OFDMA 4G technology the courses also address migration from 3G to 4G standards and the 4G techniques. It will provide a brief idea about software defined radio and cognitive radio technology and internet of things. Moreover, the course will provide the participants fundamental principles of RF systems, the design of practical and cost effective RF subsystems, and their translation into practical integrated.
