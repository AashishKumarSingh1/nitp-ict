            <b>Cryptography:</b><br />
          
          The course provides an in-depth study of cryptographic techniques and their role in practical computer systems and applications. It covers the algorithms for symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hash functions, and pseudo random number generation; and the protocols to achieve practical security objectives such as confidentiality, authentication, data integrity, non-repudiation. Associated protocols such as key distribution and public key infrastructure systems will also be covered.
