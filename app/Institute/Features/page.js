          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4">
            <li>
              Electronics and ICT Academy would be set up as a unit under the
              respective institution with the financial assistance of the
              Central Government for four years.
            </li>

            <li>
              Each Academy would ensure the following:
              <ul className="list-[circle] pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li>Entry/Exit criteria for ‘trainees’</li>
                <li>
                  Adoption of at least 10% Computer Based Training(CBT) modules
                </li>
                <li>
                  Observance of rules of reservation for SC/ST candidates as per

                <li>
                  At least 25% of trainees to be from Electronics streams.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              Each Electronics and ICT Academy would aim to provide specialized
              training to the faculties of the Engineering colleges in the
              emerging areas of electronics & ICT; and training large number of
              faculties from Arts, Commerce & Science colleges, Polytechnics,
              etc in the areas of utilisation of IT tools and techniques for
              application in their respective domain of
              knowledge/leaming/teaching/enhancing productivity, etc by
              developing state-of-the-art facilities.
            </li>

            <li>
              Each Electronics and ICT Academy would focus on improving the
              quality of faculty of institutes and colleges in the respective
              states/UTs which would result in improvement of quality of
              students there by making them industry ready and employable in the
              ICT/ Electronics Manufacturing Industry.
            </li>

            <li>
              Each Electronics and ICT Academy would offer identified training
              programmes to faculty members on contemporary industry related
              subject areas where there is industry demand but shortage of
              skills.
            </li>

            <li>
              The main thrust is to facilitate faculty to be abreast with the
              latest developments in technology and emerging industry needs.
            </li>

            <li>
              Research orientation especially to the engineering faculty of
              Electronics and IT and related streams would be emphasised by
              integrating it with the training programmes. A one/two day
              Workshop/Seminar on latest technological trends and possible
              research topics that can be taken up in these areas would be
              included in each training programme.
            </li>

            <li>
              The trained faculties are expected to train students in various
              institutes. This is expected to have a cascading effect and the
              benefit is expected to reach the large number of students in the
              respective states.
            </li>

            <li>
              In addition, each Electronics and ICT Academy could also provide
              focused training to select/ limited nos. of students in order to
              maximizing the utility of the infrastructure/facilities created in
              the academy. Further this would provide a platform for learning
              from the students training to readjust/redesign the faculty
              training/program.
            </li>

            <li>
              Each Electronics and ICT Academy would conduct standard training
              programmes that would address the basic needs of the ICTE
              industry. The Academy would also conduct specialized programmes
              based on specific industry needs from time to time. The training
              will extensively use latest internet and communication technology
              infrastructure. The course would be revised as per the latest
              industry trends in every three years.
            </li>

            <li>
              The Academies would be setup in two categories i.e. Category A and
              B. The target of Faculty Members to be trained in each of these
              Categories in 4 years are as under:

            </li>

            <li>
              Each Academy would focus on at least one newly emerging areas in
              Electronics (e.g. Automotive electronics, LEDs, Industrial
              Electronics, Medical Electronics, Telecom, Avionics, Displays,
              Rechargeable Batteries, Solar, Railways, I&B, Games) or IT (e.g.
              Localization, Virtualization, Cloud Computing, Next Generation
              Computing Systems, High Performance Computing (HPC), GIS, Mobile
              Technologies, Inter-operable Infrastructure for Small Financial
              Transactions, Switch, Language Technologies, etc.).
            </li>

            <li>
              Each Electronics and ICT Academy would be provided with a funding
              support for refurbishment of existing premises and purchase of
              equipment for setting up the state- of-art labs; support for
              Skilling/training cost per faculty being trained; Project
              Management Unit & MIS. Average training cost per candidate is
              estimated as Rs. 12,500/- per candidate depending on the total
              target assigned. The average training duration is envisaged to be
              2-weeks full-time [equivalent to a 3-credit course of about 45-48
              hrs duration with additional provision of lab/hands-on component
              and a one/two day Workshop/Seminar on latest technological trends
              and possible research topics that can be taken up in these areas].
              This cost could vary depending on the type of course and duration
              based on the level of faculty being targeted. However, the ratio
              of total skilling/training cost vs. the targets shall remain the
              same for the purpose of arriving at the total outlay and funding
              support requirement.
            </li>

            <li>
              Each Academy would aim to generate revenue by charging fee and
              taking up other activities from the second year onwards to meet
              the remaining cost in a gradual manner and become self-sustainable
              by the end of fourth year onwards.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Sustainability: </strong>
              Each Academy is expected to generate revenue by charging fee and
              taking up other activities from the second year onwards to meet
              the remaining cost in a gradual manner and become self-sustainable
              by the end of fourth year onwards. No funding support from the
              Central Government is envisaged after the completion of four year
              project duration in respect of each Academy. A steady revenue
              stream as continuous source of income generating activities of the
              Electronics and ICT Academy is expected from design and
              development of various kinds of courses aimed faculty, students,
              working professionals, conducting training both through direct
              mode as well as through on-line courses, provide Research &
              Development and other consultancy as well as capacity building and
              training services in the emerging cutting edge technologies. The
              activities could include Instruction Enhancement Programme (IEP)
              for faculty, Continuing Engineering Education Programme for
              working professionals, joint Industry Attachment Programme for
              students, enhancing the quality of institutions by guiding them to
              obtain ISO standards, etc. Other indicative set of activities that
              are envisaged to be taken by each Academy to achieve
              self-sustainability are given below:
