          <p>More courses will be added as per requirement.</p>

          <p>
            Following two courses will be offered by E&ICT Academy, NIT, Patna
            from 22nd September, 2015:
          </p>

          <div className="space-y-1">
            <p>1. Data Structure and Algorithm; and</p>
            <p>2. VLSI design and Embedded System for the state Bihar.</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            These programmes are for 10 days (total 80 hours = 50 hours Theory +
            30 hours Hands-on Experience).
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold">
            Objective of these two courses are as follows:
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold">Course -1. Data Structure and Algorithm:</p>

          <p>
            On completion of this course, trainee are expected to be capable of
            understanding the data structures, their advantages and drawbacks,
            how to implement them in C or in their known language, how their
            drawbacks can be overcome and what the applications are and where
            they can be used. Trainee should be able to learn about the data
            structures/ methods/algorithms mentioned in the course with a
            comparative perspective so as to make use of the most appropriate
            data structure/ method/algorithm in a program to enhance the
            efficiency (i.e. reduce the run-time) or for better memory
            utilization, based on the priority of the implementation. The
            trainee will also be able to understand at least the efficiency
            aspects of the graph and sorting algorithms covered in this course.
            The trainee should be able to convert an inefficient program into an
            efficient one using the knowledge gathered from this course.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold">
            Course â€“ 2. VLSI design and Embedded System
          </p>

          <p>
            Upon successful completion of this course, trainees should be able
            to analyse the operation of CMOS inverter, understand the design
            rules and layout diagram, implement the design of CMOS Memories,
            manage design issues at the layout, transistor, logic and register
            transfer levels, analyse the physical design process of VLSI design
            flow.

            Benefits for the different states covered under E&ICT Academy, NIT,
            Patna:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Bihar:</strong> Most of the Technical Institutes in Bihar
            are either very old or relatively new. Keeping this in view, the
            Academy at NIT, Patna endeavors to give in depth knowledge in terms
            of theory and experiments to the faculty of these colleges. The
            Academy will act as a Resource Center for training of not only
            Technical Institute but also Government organizations. After getting
            trained the trainees will cultivate knowledge in terms of
            entrepreneurship and research. NIT, Patna will also use the
            infrastructure provided under NMEICT scheme at various
            Institutes/colleges of Bihar.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand:</strong> NIT, Patna believes
            that reaching out to the end user will be more beneficial rather
            than moving the faculty to NIT, Patna from different States. As we
            know each technical Institute is facing problem of shortage of
            faculty hence deputing the faculty for training would be difficult.
            To overcome this, E&ICT Academy, NIT, Patna has decided to have
            co-partners in these states to host the training programme by
            providing resource persons and other logistics. This will help the
            trainee to get proper theory and practical/hands-on experience
            during the academic session itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this course, NIT, Patna has initiated the process of the signing
            the MoU with Techno Global Limited which has ten different Institute
            and Universities at West Bengal. Techno Global will share their
            resources along with faculty for training. They also have five
            Institutes in Jharkhand. In Odisha, NIT, Patna will work with NIT,
            Rourkela to organize the training programmes.
